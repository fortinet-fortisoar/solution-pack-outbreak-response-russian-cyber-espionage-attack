# Overview 

FortiGuard Labs continues to observe attack attempts exploiting the vulnerabilities highlighted in the recent CISA advisory about Russian military cyber actors. These actors are targeting U.S. and global critical infrastructure to conduct espionage, steal data, and compromise or destroy sensitive information. 

 The **Outbreak Response - Russian Cyber Espionage Attack** solution pack works with the Threat Hunt rules in [Outbreak Response Framework](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-outbreak-response-framework/blob/release/1.1.0/README.md#threat-hunt-rules) solution pack to conduct hunts that identify and help investigate potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) associated with this vulnerability within operational environments of *FortiSIEM*, *FortiAnalyzer*, *QRadar*, *Splunk*, and *Azure Log Analytics*.

 The [FortiGuard Outbreak Page](https://www.fortiguard.com/outbreak-alert/russian-cyber-espionage) contains information about the outbreak alert **Outbreak Response - Russian Cyber Espionage Attack**. 

## Background: 

Unit 29155 cyber actors are known to target critical infrastructure and key resource sectors, including the government services, financial services, transportation systems, energy, and healthcare sectors of NATO members, the EU, Central American, and Asian countries since 2020. 

CISA's analysis concluded Unit 29155 cyber actors have exploited multiple CVEs for initial access. These CVEs primarily involve remote code execution, authentication bypass, privilege escalation, and buffer overflow issues affecting products and software such as Dahua IP Cameras, Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center, and Sophos Firewall Vulnerabilities. 

According to the advisory, to date, the FBI has observed more than 14,000 instances of domain scanning across at least 26 NATO members and several additional European Union (EU) countries.
